**HPMOR-LyX**
=========

This Repo was born with the idea of having paper printed books of hpmor. Details can be found on hpmor.com.
My goal was to have a book with:
- original 4 chapters
- no illustrations
- good readable font
- pages with nice formatted chapters
- beautiful hard covers

Contents of the repo
- original LyX files for chapters
- exported pdfs
- pdfs ready to print with Blurb

After the fork the following work was done:
- removing illustrations
- adjusting print to 6x9"
- adjusting first pages, removing numbering from beginning
- removing notes
- moving contents from odd to even pages in exported pdfs
- whenever I was exporting PDFs - they came in a wrong paper size, I cropped them with Acrobat DC
- minor adjustments in text, especially in 2nd volume, chapter beginnings were messed
